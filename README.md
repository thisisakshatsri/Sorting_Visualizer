The Sorting Visualizer is web based project that aims to demonstrate diffrent sorting algorithms in a visual and interactive way. The user can select the sorting algorithm of choice and watch the visual representation of the sorting process in real time.

The project includes popular sorting algorithms such as bubble sort, insertion sort, selection sort, merge sort, quick sort. Additionally, users can also input their own data sets or randomize the data set to see the sorting algoritms in action. 

The purpose of this project is to provide a clear understanding of how each sorting algorithms works and to compare the efficiency of diffrent algorithms.
